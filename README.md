#### Requirements

- MySQL v5.5+
- OpenResty v1.9.7.3+ or Nginx+lua module
    - install OpenResty with `--with-http_stub_status_module` option
- [Lor Framework](https://github.com/sumory/lor) please mind:

    - Orange v0.6.2+ is compatible with lor v0.3.0+

Import the SQL file(e.g. install/orange-v0.7.0.sql) which is adapted to your Orange version into MySQL database named `orange`.
- Install luarocks and opm tools
    - The Version of luarocks is higher than LuaRocks 2.2.2
    - Opm tool is integrated in Openresty, it is under the openresty/bin directory


#### Install and Config

1) Install dependencies

```bash
#cd orange         // Go to the Orange root directory
#opm --install-dir=./ get zhangbao0325/orangelib      //opm download the 3rd packages
#luarocks install luafilesystem         //luarocks install lua dependencies             
#luarocks install luasocket
#luarocks install lrandom
```

2) Generate configuration file
```bash
#cd conf
#cp orange.conf.example orange.conf
#cp nginx.conf.example nginx.conf
```
Attention:    
 - the directive  "store_mysql" in orange.conf should be modified as your mysql configuration,
 - the directive  "lua_package_path" should add your lua package installation path of luarocks tool;    

3) script management

use shell scripts (e.g. `start.sh`) to manage Orange.

4) CLI tools

In addition to `start.sh` script, a new cli tool could be utilized to manage Orange. You should install the cli first:

```bash
// orange root  directory
# make install  // Installation CLI tools
```

then, the Orange runtime lua module is installed in `/usr/local/orange` and an executable command named `/usr/local/bin/orange` is generated.

#### Usages

Before starting Orange, you should ensure that the `orange.conf` and `nginx.conf` are redefined to satisfy the demands of your project.
