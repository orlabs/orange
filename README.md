A Gateway based on OpenResty(Nginx+lua) for API Monitoring and Management.


### Install & Usages

#### Requirements

- MySQL v5.5+
- OpenResty v1.9.7.3+ or Nginx+lua module
- [Lor Framework](https://github.com/sumory) v0.1.4+
- libuuid.so

Import the SQL file(e.g. install/orange-v0.6.0.sql) which is adapted to your Orange version to MySQL database named `orange`.

#### Install

**1) version < 0.5.0**

If you use Orange under v0.5.0, there is no need to `install`.

**2) version >= 0.5.0**

In addition to `start.sh` script, a new cli tool could be utilized to manage Orange. You should install the cli first:

```
cd orange
make install
```

then, the Orange runtime lua module is installed in `/usr/local/orange` and an executable command named `/usr/local/bin/orange` is generated.


#### Usages

Before starting Orange, you should ensure that the `orange.conf` and `nginx.conf` are redefined to satisfy the demands of your project.


**1) version < 0.5.0**

Just `sh start.sh` to start Orange. You could rewrite some other shell scripts as you need.

**2) version >= 0.5.0**
